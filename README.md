# BR-Flickr

## Intro
Hello, thanks for viewing my Flickr Kotlin App. I saw this as an opportunity to not only showcase my talents but also improve my kotlin skills, as I primarily use Java. I was excited to use some android's newest libraries and really liked what I saw. I was able to hit all requirements and all extra mile tasks except unit testing. This was a fun project and I enjoyed building it. Hope you like it.

## Architecture
I choose a MVVM architecture. It allowed me to build out quickly and maintain the repository.

## Dependencies
* Retrofit2
* Okhttp3
* Room
* Coroutines
* Glide
* Lifecycle

## Future Work
* Use Dagger
  * This was a small app but as this app grows, dagger will be a great tool for dependency injection
  * Dagger will also allow me to quickly build out unit tests

* Build out search for bookmarks
  * I built out the skeleton for this but didn't implement.
